With this asset you can easily create levels for your platformer game!

Pack includes:
-69 unique sprites (boxes, spikes, platfroms and decorative elements)
-2 ground tilesets
-Customizable trees
-5 layer parallax background
-Fog and clouds for background
-Blurry islands with trees and plants for background and foreground
-Characters sprites & simple animations

How to create a parallax effect like in the demo scene:

1) Set the projection of main camera to perspective;
2) Put background layers (mountains or islands) further away from the camera by increasing their z-position. The larger z-position is, the farther the object will be;
3) Dont forget about order in layer property in sprite renderer settings of each background layer: distant objects should have less order in layer then near ones;
4) If you are using a blurry version of the background, then I recommend you to place the blurrier layers further away from the camera.

For the foreground:

1) The lower the z-position, the closer the object will be to the camera;
2) The blurrier objects should be closer to the camera and they should be darker (you can change their color is sprite renderer settings);
